# Weather-Application
This Weather Application is built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data. The application allows users to enter the name of a city and retrieve its current weather details, including:

Temperature (converted from Kelvin to Celsius)
Pressure (in hPa)
Humidity (as a percentage)
Weather description (e.g., clear sky, cloudy, etc.)

Features of the Application:
Interactive GUI: The app provides an easy-to-use interface where users can input a city name.
Dynamic Weather Data: Weather information is fetched in real-time using an API.
Error Handling: The app handles cases where the city is not found or the weather data is unavailable.
Clear Display: The fetched weather details are displayed in a well-organized format for user readability.

This application showcases how Python can integrate third-party APIs and create functional GUIs to develop a real-world utility program.
